# RESULTS ANALYSIS ENGINE
# =============================================================================
#
# Runs evaluation and prediction analysis on processed MFCC features.
#
# FUNCTION:
# ---------
# - Runs evaluate.py on standardized evaluation features
# - Runs predict.py using trained songbird.pkl model
# - Generates analysis reports and predictions
#
# PREREQUISITES:
# --------------
# - results/evaluation_standardized.csv (from MFCC processing)
# - songbird.pkl (trained model)
# - Training completed successfully
#
# SAFETY:
# -------
# ðŸŸ¢ SAFE - Analysis only, no recording or file modification
#
# OUTPUT:
# -------
# - Statistical evaluation reports
# - Model predictions on modified audio
# - Performance metrics and analysis
#
# INTEGRATION:
# ------------
# Final step in evaluation pipeline
# Called by songbird-pipeline.sh evaluation and quick
