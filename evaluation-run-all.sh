# COMPLETE EVALUATION ORCHESTRATOR
# =============================================================================
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DESTRUCTIVE - Runs complete evaluation pipeline including recording
#
# PIPELINE STAGES:
# ----------------
# 1. Setup environment (safe)
# 2. Record modified audio (‚ö†Ô∏è  DESTRUCTIVE - overwrites existing)
# 3. Process MFCC features (safe)
# 4. Analyze results (safe)
#
# CRITICAL WARNING:
# -----------------
# üî¥ OVERWRITES all existing recordings in working-evaluation/
# üî¥ 20-45 minute process requiring hardware interaction
# üî¥ Cannot be undone
#
# RECOMMENDATION:
# ---------------
# Use songbird-pipeline.sh evaluation instead - better error handling
# and user guidance.
#
# ERROR HANDLING:
# ---------------
# - Stops on first failure
# - Reports which stage failed
# - Allows manual recovery
#
# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
# ----------------------
# - Teensy device connected and functional
# - SwitchAudioSource installed
# - Proper audio routing setup
